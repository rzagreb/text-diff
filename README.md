## Advanced Usage

### Pre-Populate Texts via URL

Text Diff can automatically fill text areas using the `q` URL parameter, separating texts with `|||`. For example:

```
https://rzagreb.github.io/text-diff?q=Hello%20World%20|||Hello%20Universe
```

### Add as a Custom Search Engine in Chrome

1. **Open Chrome Settings** > **Search engine** > **Manage search engines**.
2. **Add a new search engine**:
   - **Name:** Text Diff
   - **Keyword:** `diff`
   - **URL:** `https://rzagreb.github.io/text-diff?q=%s`
3. **Use it** by typing `diff` followed by your texts separated by `|||` in the address bar, e.g., `diff Hello World ||| Hello Universe`.
